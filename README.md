#Welcome to the Weather App!

This application allows you to quickly and easily access current weather information for any location across the globe. By utilizing the Weather API, we are able to provide accurate and up-to-date weather data for your convenience.

To get started, simply enter the name of the location you would like to check the weather for in the search bar. Once you hit "search", the app will retrieve the current weather data for that location and display it on the screen.

The weather information displayed includes the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather conditions. Additionally, you will see a visual representation of the weather conditions through icons and images.

We hope you find the Weather App to be a useful tool for your daily life, whether you are planning a trip, preparing for a weather event, or just curious about the conditions in other parts of the world. Enjoy!
